# Students_Marks_prediction
Student performance prediction is a common project in machine learning (ML) that uses data mining and predictive analytics
techniques to analyze student data and predict their future academic performance. 
This project is often undertaken by schools and educational institutions to identify students who may be at risk of falling behind or dropping out, 
and to provide them with targeted interventions and support.

   The project typically involves collecting data on various factors that may impact student performance, 
 such as attendance, grades, demographics, socioeconomic status, and extracurricular activities.
 This data is then processed and analyzed using ML algorithms to identify patterns and trends that can be used to predict future academic performance.
